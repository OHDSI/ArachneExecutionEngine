# ARACHNE Execution Environments

ARACHNE DataNode runs R code in pre-specified runtime environments. These environments are created using dockerfiles. Currently there are two example runtime environments each with their own subfolder here. Arachne users can create their own runtime environments by copying and modifying the dockerfiles found in this directory.
